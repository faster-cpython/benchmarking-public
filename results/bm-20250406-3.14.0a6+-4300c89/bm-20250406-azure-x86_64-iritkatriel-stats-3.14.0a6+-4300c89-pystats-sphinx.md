## Execution counts

<details>
<summary> Execution counts for Tier 1 instructions. </summary>


The "miss ratio" column shows the percentage of times the instruction
executed that it deoptimized. When this happens, the base unspecialized
instruction is not counted.


</details>

## Pair counts

<details>
<summary> Pair counts for top 100 opcode pairs </summary>


Pairs of specialized operations that deoptimize and are then followed by
the corresponding unspecialized instruction are not counted as pairs.


</details>

## Predecessor/Successor Pairs

<details>
<summary> Top 5 predecessors and successors of each Tier 1 opcode. </summary>


This does not include the unspecialized instructions that occur after a
specialized instruction deoptimizes.


</details>

## Specialization stats

<details>
<summary> Specialization stats by family </summary>


</details>

## Specialization effectiveness

<details>
<summary> specialization effectiveness </summary>


All entries are execution counts. Should add up to the total number of
Tier 1 instructions executed.

## Call stats

<details>
<summary> Inlined calls and frame stats </summary>


This shows what fraction of calls to Python functions are inlined (i.e.
not having a call at the C level) and for those that are not, where the
call comes from.  The various categories overlap.

Also includes the count of frame objects created.


</details>

## Object stats

<details>
<summary> Allocations, frees and dict materializatons </summary>


Below, "allocations" means "allocations that are not from a freelist".
Total allocations = "Allocations from freelist" + "Allocations".

"Inline values" is the number of values arrays inlined into objects.

The cache hit/miss numbers are for the MRO cache, split into dunder and
other names.


</details>

## GC stats

<details>
<summary> GC collections and effectiveness </summary>


Collected/visits gives some measure of efficiency.

<summary> statistics about the Tier 2 optimizer </summary>
